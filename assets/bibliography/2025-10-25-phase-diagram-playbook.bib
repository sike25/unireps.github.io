In a trustworthy projection the visualized proximities hold in the original data as well, whereas a continuous projection visualizes all proximities of the original data. We show experimentally that one of the multidimensional scaling methods, curvilinear components analysis, is good at maximizing trustworthiness. We then extend it to focus on local proximities both in the input and output space, and to explicitly make a user-tunable parameterized compromise between trustworthiness and continuity. The new method compares favorably to alternative nonlinear projection methods.}

 abstract = {Consider two data matrices on the same sample of n individuals, X(p × n), Y(q × n). From these matrices, geometrical representations of the sample are obtained as two configurations of n points, in Rp and Rq. It is shown that the RV-coefficient (Escoufier, 1970, 1973) can be used as a measure of similarity of the two configurations, taking into account the possibly distinct metrics to be used on them to measure the distances between points. The purpose of this paper is to show that most classical methods of linear multivariate statistical analysis can be interpreted as the search for optimal linear transformations or, equivalently, the search for optimal metrics to apply on two data matrices on the same sample; the optimality is defined in terms of the similarity of the corresponing configurations of points. which, in turn, calls for the maximization of the associated RV-coefficient. The methods studied are principal components, principal components of instrumental variables, multivariate regression, canonical variables, discriminant analysis; they are differentiated by the possible relationships existing between the two data matrices involved and by additional constraints under which the maximum of RV is to be obtained. It is also shown that the RV-coefficient can be used as a measure of goodness of a solution to the problem of discarding variables.},

Robust locally weighted regression is a method for smoothing a scatterplot, (xi, yi), i = 1, ⋯, n, in which the fitted value at xk is the value of a polynomial fit to the data using weighted least squares, where the weight for (xi, yi) is large if xi is close to xk and small if it is not. A robust fitting procedure is used that guards against deviant points distorting the smoothed points. Visual, computational, and statistical issues of robust locally weighted regression are discussed. Several examples, including data on lead intoxication, are used to illustrate the methodology.},

% l1-regularized logistic for Ising graph selection
@article{ravikumar2010ising,
 ISSN = {00905364, 21688966},
 URL = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/20744454},
 abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating the graph associated with a binary Ising Markov random field. We describe a method based on ℓ₁-regularized logistic regression, in which the neighborhood of any given node is estimated by performing logistic regression subject to an ℓ₁-constraint. The method is analyzed under high-dimensional scaling in which both the number of nodes p and maximum neighborhood size d are allowed to grow as a function of the number of observations n. Our main results provide sufficient conditions on the triple (n, p, d) and the model parameters for the method to succeed in consistently estimating the neighborhood of every node in the graph simultaneously. With coherence conditions imposed on the population Fisher information matrix, we prove that consistent neighborhood selection can be obtained for sample sizes n = Ω(d³ log p) with exponentially decaying error. When these same conditions are imposed directly on the sample matrices, we show that a reduced sample size of n = Ω(d² log p) suffices for the method to estimate neighborhoods consistently. Although this paper focuses on the binary graphical models, we indicate how a generalization of the method of the paper would apply to general discrete Markov random fields.},

    abstract = {Topological characteristics of multidimensional potential energy surfaces are explored and the full conformation space is mapped on the set of local minima. This map partitions conformation space into energy-dependent or temperature-dependent “attraction basins’’ and generates a “disconnectivity’’ graph that reflects the basin connectivity and characterizes the shape of the multidimensional surface. The partitioning of the conformation space is used to express the temporal behavior of the system in terms of basin-to-basin kinetics instead of the usual state-to-state transitions. For this purpose the transition matrix of the system is expressed in terms of basin-to-basin transitions and the corresponding master equation is solved. As an example, the approach is applied to the tetrapeptide, isobutyryl-(ala)3-NH-methyl (IAN), which is the shortest peptide that can form a full helical turn. A nearly complete list of minima and barriers is available for this system from the work of Czerminiski and Elber. The multidimensional potential energy surface of the peptide is shown to exhibit an overall “funnel’’ shape. The relation between connectivity and spatial proximity in dihedral angle space is examined. It is found that, although the two are similar, closeness in one does not always imply closeness in the other. The basin to basin kinetics is examined using a master equation and the results are interpreted in terms of kinetic connectivity. The conformation space of the peptide is divided up in terms of the surface topography to model its “folding’’ behavior. Even in this very simple system, the kinetics exhibit a “trapping’’ state which appears as a “kinetic intermediate,’’ as in the folding of proteins. The approach described here can be used more generally to classify multidimensional potential energy surfaces and the time development of complex systems.},

abstract = {Ultrasound sensitivity to slow blood flow motion gained two orders of magnitude in the last decade thanks to the advent of ultrafast ultrasound imaging at thousands of frames per second. In neuroscience, this access to small cerebral vessels flow led to the introduction of ultrasound as a new and full-fledged neuroimaging modality. Much as functional MRI or functional optical imaging, functional Ultrasound (fUS) takes benefit of the neurovascular coupling. Its ease of use, portability, spatial and temporal resolution makes it an attractive tool for functional imaging of brain activity in preclinical imaging. A large and fast-growing number of studies in a wide variety of small to large animal models have demonstrated its potential for neuroscience research. Beyond preclinical imaging, first proof of concept applications in humans are promising and proved a clear clinical interest in particular in human neonates, per-operative surgery, or even for the development of non-invasive brain machine interfaces.}

   abstract = "Functional ultrasound (fUS) is a neuroimaging method that uses ultrasound to track changes in cerebral blood volume as an indirect readout of neuronal activity at high spatiotemporal resolution. fUS is capable of imaging head-fixed or freely behaving rodents and of producing volumetric images of the entire mouse brain. It has been applied to many species, including primates and humans. Now that fUS is reaching maturity, it is being adopted by the neuroscience community. However, the nature of the fUS signal and the different implementations of fUS are not necessarily accessible to nonspecialists. This review aims to introduce these ultrasound concepts to all neuroscientists. We explain the physical basis of the fUS signal and the principles of the method, present the state of the art of its hardware implementation, and give concrete examples of current applications in neuroscience. Finally, we suggest areas for improvement during the next few years.",
